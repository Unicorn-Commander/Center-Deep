# Center Deep SearXNG Development Roadmap

This document outlines the future development goals and a master checklist for the Center Deep SearXNG fork.

## I. Core Enhancements

*   **Graphical Admin Section (High Priority)**:
    *   **Objective**: Develop a web-based administrative interface to manage SearXNG backend settings without direct file editing.
    *   **Key Features**:
        *   User authentication and authorization for secure access.
        *   Dashboard for monitoring instance health and basic statistics.
        *   Configuration management for `settings.yml` parameters (e.g., instance name, default theme, safe search).
        *   **BrightData Proxy Management**: Graphical controls to enable/disable BrightData proxy and configure credentials.
        *   Ability to apply configuration changes and restart the SearXNG service from the UI.
    *   **Technical Considerations**:
        *   Choice of web framework for the admin UI (e.g., Flask, Node.js with Express, or integrate within SearXNG's existing Flask app if feasible).
        *   API development for interacting with SearXNG's configuration.
        *   Secure storage and handling of sensitive credentials (e.g., BrightData API keys).

*   **Advanced Theme Customization**:
    *   Further refine the `center_deep_light`, `center_deep_dark`, and `magic_unicorn` themes.
    *   Implement more dynamic styling options.
    *   Explore custom fonts and iconography.

*   **Custom Search Homepage Layout**:
    *   Design and implement a unique search homepage layout that aligns with the Center Deep branding beyond just logos and text.
    *   Consider interactive elements or custom search suggestions.

## II. Integration & Deployment

*   **Production Deployment Guide**:
    *   Document best practices for deploying Center Deep SearXNG to a Linux production server.
    *   Include details on Nginx/Caddy proxy setup, SSL/TLS configuration, and process management (e.g., systemd).

*   **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    *   Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline for automated testing and deployment of the fork.

## III. Maintenance & Operations

*   **Automated Updates**:
    *   Investigate strategies for easily updating the SearXNG base while preserving Center Deep customizations.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting**:
    *   Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for real-time performance tracking and alerts.
