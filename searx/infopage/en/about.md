## How do I set it as the default search engine?

SearXNG supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.
- [Chromium]-based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.

When adding a search engine, there must be no duplicates with the same name.  If
you encounter a problem where you cannot add the search engine, you can either:

- Remove the duplicate (default name: SearXNG) or
- Contact the owner to give the instance a different name from the default.

## How does it work?

SearXNG is a fork of the well-known [searx] [metasearch engine] which was
inspired by the [Seeks project].  It provides basic privacy by mixing your
queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.  SearXNG
can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the
default search engine.

The {{link('stats page', 'stats')}} contains some useful anonymous usage
statistics about the engines used.

## How can I make it my own?

SearXNG appreciates your concern regarding logs, so take the code from the
[SearXNG sources] and run it yourself!

Add your instance to this [list of public
instances]({{get_setting('brand.public_instances')}}) to help other people
reclaim their privacy and make the internet freer.  The more decentralized the
internet is, the more freedom we have!
